Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

I learned how to structure my code better by practicing the SOLID principles, how to implement async middleware by using redux-thunk. I also improved on my error handling. 
From my experience building this app, i noticed that one needs to plan his web app architecture properly before developing the app, know which errors that can affect the whole app or specific part.
